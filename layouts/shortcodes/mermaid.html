<!-- This is quite bad since if you have multiple mermaid diagrams, the scrip will be downloaded as many times. -->
<!-- One proper solution is to include this in the footer -->
<div class="mermaid" align="{{ if .Get "align" }}
                                {{ .Get "align" }}
                            {{ else }}
                                center
                            {{ end }}">
    {{ safeHTML .Inner }}
</div>
